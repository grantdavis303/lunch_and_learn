### Goals

Overall Goal

- [ ] A user should be able search for cuisines by country and should also be able to learn more about that country's culture.

Learning Goals

- [ ] Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- [ ] Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- [ ] Implement basic authentication
- [ ] Search for recipes by country
- [ ] Mark specific recipes as 'favorite'
- [ ] Learn more about a particular country
- [ ] Test both API consumption and exposure, and use one mocking tool(VCR, Webmock)

Technical Presentation

- [ ] Student presents their code and is able to talk about all of the presentation points below.

Presentation Points

- [ ] Demonstration of understanding for project’s learning goals
- [ ] Demonstration of functional completeness using Postman and live demo
- [ ] Discussion of technical quality & code organization
- [ ] Discussion of test coverage (happy and sad path and edge case testing)

Feature Delivery

- [ ] API satisfies the exact needs of the frontend developers. No unnecessary information is sent in a response.

Technical Quality

- [ ] Project demonstrates abstraction and encapsulation in ways that make it easy to change (example: if an API changes, for example, FLickr to Unsplashed, we make changes in as few places as possible.). 
- [ ] Project shows a solid understanding of MVC principles (this may include but is not limited to: no logic in serializers, clean controllers, serializers and presenters to handle formatting rather than models etc.) and includes all expectations of numbers 1 and 2 above.

Testing

- [ ] Project achieves 90% or greater test coverage. 
- [ ] In addition to “happy path”, project also includes “sad path”/edge case testing. 
- [ ] At least one of the tests that require an external API call make use of VCR and/or Webmock for mocking. 
- [ ] Tests check payload content a little deeper such as inspecting data type of an attribute. 
- [ ] Testing also checks that unnecessary information is NOT present in response data.
